# AWS Lambda Basics:  
-AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).  
-Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.  
-Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services.  
## How does it work?  

-AWS Lambda operates by running each function in its own isolated container, with AWS handling the management of the underlying infrastructure. When a function is created, Lambda packages it into a container and runs it on AWS-managed machines, allocating the necessary resources like RAM and CPU. After execution, you're charged based on the allocated memory and runtime.  

-Lambda's infrastructure is fully handled by AWS, sparing customers from infrastructure maintenance concerns. While this offers convenience, it means sacrificing control over the underlying infrastructure.   

- A notable feature of AWS Lambda is its ability to run many instances of the same or different functions concurrently, with concurrency levels that can vary by time. You're billed only for the compute resources your functions use, making it ideal for highly scalable cloud solutions.
  
## Questions:  
1. What is AWS Lambda?
-AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to run code in response to events without the need to manage servers.

2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.
- Real-time File Processing
- Data Transformation
- Scheduled Tasks

3. Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.
- "Serverless" means you can run your computer programs without having to worry about managing the actual computers they run on, making it easier and more efficient to use technology.


# CDN  
- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed across different locations that work together to deliver internet content like web pages, images, and videos quickly to users. CDNs function by copying website pages to these servers, caching the content, and then redirecting user requests to the nearest CDN server, improving page loading speed. This setup benefits users by reducing the distance data needs to travel, resulting in faster loading times. Many popular websites, including Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon, use CDNs to enhance their performance. Additionally, CDNs offer cybersecurity benefits, such as protection against cyberattacks like Denial of Service (DoS), thanks to their ability to handle more traffic and hardware failures effectively compared to origin servers.

## Questions:  
1.What is a CDN?  
- a network of servers distributed across different locations that work together to deliver internet content

2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?
- A CDN works by redirecting website visitors' requests to the nearest CDN server, reducing data travel distance and speeding up content delivery.

3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?
- faster website loading times, improved user experience, reduced latency, enhanced content delivery, better scalability, protection against cyberattacks like DDoS, and bandwidth cost savings.
