# Creating HyperLinks:  

Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.  
A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an &lt;a> element and using the href attribute.  
ex:  

&lt;p>  
  I'm creating a link to  
  &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a>.  
&lt;/p>  

Heading link structure:  

&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">  
  &lt;h1>MDN Web Docs&lt;/h1>  
&lt;/a>

# CSS Layout:  

There are a few differnet layouts on how a page will flow (usually top to bottom). Some of the different layouts are normal flow, flexbox, Grids, etc.  

## Normal flow:  
This is the best way to begin a page. It ensures that the content is readable even if the user's using a very limited browser.  
By default, a block-level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it, growing along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline-level elements is just the size of their content.   
You can set width or height on some elements that have a default display property value of inline, like &lt;img>, but display value will still remain inline.  

## CSS Layout: Positioning:  

Positioning allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and make them behafe differently.  
Positoning also ovverrides normal document flow. There are a few position properties: static positioniong,relative positioning, and also absolute positioning.  

# Questions:  

What is meant by “normal flow”?  
- The default layout behavior of elements on a webpage.

What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?  
- Box model, line break, width and height, nesting, etc.

___ positioning is the default for every html element.  
-static positioning  

Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.  
-precise placement, layering and overlapping, and indepenednt of document flow  

What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?  
- The reference point and viewpointpositioning.



# Learn JS:  

JS is a programming language that allows you to implement complex functionalities on web pages.  

isplaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, and more.  

# Functions — reusable blocks of code:  

Functions allow me to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then I can call that single code whenever i need to do that class.  

# Questions:  

Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.  
-A function declaration in JavaScript is the act of defining a function, specifying its name and parameters, and describing the actions it will perform when called, whereas a function invocation is the execution or calling of a function to perform the actions defined within its declaration.

# Miscellaneous  

Two benefits of pair programming are Greater efficiency and Job interview readiness.  

Both of these things could benefit me in my coding journey because time is money and also I know in order to get a job, there will be an extensive interview before the job. Once I am able to dial in on these two things, my coding journey will not only begin, but it will be fun.
