# Event-Driven Programming in Node.js  
- Event programming is a software design paradigm where actions or functions are triggered in response to specific events or conditions, often used in graphical user interfaces and real-time systems.
- The eventEmitter: a programming construct or component in many event-driven languages and frameworks that allows objects to emit named events and subscribe to those events, facilitating communication between different parts of a program or system.
- How to access it: We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported weâ€™ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.

## Questions:  
1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
- events module  

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
-  It can help organize and encapsulate code, making it more modular and maintainable when used in tandem with Event Driven Programming, allowing for better management of event handlers and their associated data and behavior.
  
3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
- It is like having a waiter at a restaurant who listens to your requests (events), such as ordering food or drinks, and serves them when ready, ensuring efficient and timely handling of various tasks, just like how it helps manage interactions in a web browser.

# Additional Questions  
-I look forward to learning about the new problem domain.
- My learning goal is to be a better programmer.
