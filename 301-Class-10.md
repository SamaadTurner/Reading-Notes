# The JavaScript Call Stack  

## JavaScript Engine and Hosting Environment:  

-JavaScript engine is single-threaded with a heap and a call stack.  
-Web APIs (DOM, AJAX, Timers) are provided by the browser.  

## Call Stack:  

-Primarily used for function invocation.  
-Executes functions one at a time, synchronously.    
-Understanding the call stack is crucial for comprehending function hierarchy and execution order.  

## Asynchronous Programming:  

-Involves callback functions, an event loop, and a task queue.  
-Callbacks executed by the call stack after being pushed by the event loop.  

## Call Stack Definition:  

-A data structure following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.  
-Stores and manages function invocations temporarily.  

## LIFO Principle:  

-Last function pushed is the first to pop out when a function returns.  

## Demonstration of LIFO:  

-Functions stacked with the last function on top.  
-Error occurs in reverse order: last-in-first-out.  

## Temporarily Store:  

-Function invocation pushes function, parameters, and variables to form a stack frame.  
-Stack frame memory cleared when function returns and pops out.  

## Manage Function Invocation:  

-Call stack records stack frame positions.  
-Controls the sequence of function execution, making JavaScript synchronous.  

## Analogy: Queue at a Grocery Store:  

-Illustrates synchronous execution like standing in a queue.  

## Handling Function Calls:  

-Execution step-by-step with a sample code example.  

## Stack Overflow:  

-Occurs with recursive functions lacking an exit point.  
-Browser has a maximum stack call limit before throwing an error.  

## Key Takeaways:  

-JavaScript engine is single-threaded, capable of only one action at a time.  
-Code execution is synchronous.  
-Function invocation creates a stack frame temporarily in memory.  
-Call stack operates as Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure.  

## Questions:  
1.What is a ‘call’?  
- invoking or executing a function in a program, triggering its code to run and potentially return a result.
2.How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
-one
3.What does LIFO mean?
-Last in, First Out.
4.Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack
-Imagine a call stack with three functions: main, calculate, and multiply, where main calls calculate, and calculate calls multiply, resulting in the call stack order of main -> calculate -> multiply.
5.What causes a Stack Overflow?
-call stack reaches its maximum capacity due to excessive function recursion without proper termination conditions, leading to a runtime error.

# Javascript error messages:  
The majority of a developer's time is often devoted to reading and debugging code. This process involves identifying and resolving errors, commonly referred to as "bugs." Error messages play a crucial role in this, highlighting issues in the code. They include information about the error type, context, and call stack, which shows the path the program took to reach the error.  

Four main types of errors are commonly encountered:  

Reference errors: These occur when attempting to use a variable that hasn't been declared. For example, accessing an undeclared variable like foo would result in a reference error.  
Syntax errors: These errors are caused by incorrect syntax in the code. For instance, attempting to parse an invalid JSON object would lead to a syntax error.  
Range errors: These errors emerge when manipulating objects with invalid lengths. For instance, attempting to set a negative length for an array would trigger a range error.  
Type errors: Type errors arise when incompatible data types are used or accessed. Trying to access a property of an undefined variable, such as foo.bar.baz, would lead to a type error.  
Debugging methods involve using techniques like console logging, breakpoints, and the call stack:  
Console logging: Developers often use console.log() to inspect variables and values during code execution to identify issues.  
Breakpoints: Developers can set breakpoints in their code using tools like browser developer tools or code editors. Breakpoints pause code execution at a specific line, allowing inspection of variables and values.  
Call stack: The call stack shows the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the code. Understanding the call stack helps trace the path of execution and identify errors.  
Handling errors is essential to prevent code crashes and ensure a smooth user experience. One common approach is using try...catch blocks to capture errors and handle them gracefully. This prevents unhandled errors from crashing the application and allows for fallback mechanisms.  
Using tools like quokka and eslint can aid in identifying errors and enforcing coding standards. TypeScript offers strong typing for JavaScript, enhancing code quality and reducing errors.  

## Questions:  
1. What is a ‘reference error’?
-when an attempt is made to use a variable that has not been declared or is not in scope.  
2.What is a ‘syntax error’?  
-when the code is written in an invalid structure or format that doesn't conform to the language's rules.  
3.What is a ‘range error’?  
-when a value used to manipulate an object's length or index is outside the acceptable range or bounds.  
4.What is a ‘type error’?  
-peration is performed on a value of an incompatible data type, or when attempting to access properties or methods on a variable of an undefined or inappropriate type.  
5.What is a breakpoint?  
-a location in the code where program execution can be paused for debugging purposes, enabling examination of variables and code behavior at that point.  
6.What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?  
-refers to a tool or software that aids developers in identifying and rectifying errors in their code by allowing them to inspect variables, control program execution, and diagnose issues.
