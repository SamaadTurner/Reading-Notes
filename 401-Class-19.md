# AWS SQS vs SNS  

- SQS and SNS are important components for scalable, large-scale, distributed, cloud-based applications:
- SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service.
- SQS is distributed queuing service.
- Amazon SNS is a fully managed push notification service by Amazon.  
- It supports sending messages to individual recipients or bulk messages to large audiences.  
- SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe system, delivering messages to subscribers when publishers send them.  
- It offers versatile endpoints, including email, SMS, HTTP, and SQS.  
- Ideal for scenarios where the number and types of subscribers are unknown.  
- SNS allows for sending push notifications to a variety of mobile devices (Apple, Google, Fire OS, Windows), including Android devices in China via Baidu Cloud Push.  
- It can also be used to send SMS messages to mobile users in the US and emails to recipients worldwide.

## Questions:  
1. What is the difference betweeen SQS and SNS?
- Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queuing service that decouples the components of a cloud application, while Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a publish-subscribe service that sends messages to subscribers and is used for distributing messages to multiple endpoints, such as email, SMS, and more.

2. What are some use cases for both SNS and SQS?
- Amazon SNS is commonly used for broadcasting messages and notifications to multiple subscribers, such as sending alerts to mobile devices or emails, while Amazon SQS is employed for decoupling and managing asynchronous, distributed systems, often used to balance workloads and ensure reliable message processing.

# AWS SNS and SQS  
1. Describe how to use SQS and SNS in a “fanout” pattern.
- In a "fanout" pattern, you can use Amazon SNS to publish messages to a topic, and multiple Amazon SQS queues can subscribe to that topic, allowing messages to be distributed to each queue independently.

2. Explain how “push notifications” work, using SNS.
- Amazon SNS enables "push notifications" by allowing publishers to send messages to a topic, and subscribers, such as mobile devices, subscribe to the topic to receive those messages in real-time.

# SQS and SNS Basics  
1. How might a large scale, distributed application make use of a Queue system like SQS?
- A large scale, distributed application can use SQS to decouple components, manage workloads, and ensure reliable message processing, enabling efficient communication between various parts of the system without direct dependencies.
