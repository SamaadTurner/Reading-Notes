# What Is Node and When Should I Use It?  
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.  
- Node.js is event-based, non-blocking, and asynchronous.  
- Node.js is used to execute JavaScript on computers and is a JavaScript runtime.  
- Node.js uses the V8 engine but isn't executed in a browser.  
- Node.js enhances V8 with features like a file system API and HTTP library.  
- Node.js supports modern JavaScript, such as ES6 and beyond.  
- Node.js comes with npm, the world's largest software registry for JavaScript packages.  
-npm is used for managing packages and dependencies.  
- Node.js is used for automating development processes, like bundling and testing.  
It's essential for modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular.  
- Node.js is used to run JavaScript on servers; it's single-threaded and event-driven.  
- Node's execution model is non-blocking and handles many simultaneous connections.  
- Node is beneficial for real-time interactions, APIs, data streaming, and collaboration apps.  
- Node's execution model reduces the overhead on the server.  
- Node's single-threaded nature requires avoiding blocking I/O and proper error handling.  
- Node is suitable for both complex and simple applications.  
- Node is often used with Express, a minimal framework for building web applications.
## Questions  
1.What is node.js?

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
-npm install -g jshint
8.What is node used for?
-
Node is used for building various types of applications, particularly those involving real-time interactions, APIs, data streaming, and collaboration, due to its ability to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently.  

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming  
-Pair programming involves two developers collaborating on a single coding task, with one as the Driver typing and the other as the Navigator guiding.  
-Pair programming improves communication, problem-solving, and coding skills.  
-It enhances efficiency, catches mistakes early, and produces higher-quality code.  
-Engaged collaboration keeps both programmers focused and accountable.  
-Learning from each other exposes developers to new techniques and approaches.  
-Pair programming develops social and interpersonal skills.  
-It prepares individuals for job interviews and work environments.  
-Many companies use pair programming in their interview processes to assess collaboration and communication.  
-Pair programming aligns with the skills required in the workplace, making graduates more prepared for their careers.  

## Questions:
1.What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?  
-Greater efficiency, Engaged Collaboration, Learning from fellow students, social skill, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.  
2.In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?  
-I would say greater efficiency... USUALLY two heads are better than one.  
3.How does pair programming work?  
- Driver who types the code and a Navigator who guides and strategizes – fostering collaboration and improving coding quality through real-time interaction.
