# Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials  
1. What is the first principle of Redux?
-The first principle of Redux is that the entire state of your application is stored in a single, centralized store, serving as the sole source of truth for your data.

2. what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?
- A store in Redux is a JavaScript object that holds the entire state of an application, and reducers within the store are used to manage and update that state based on dispatched actions.

3. Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.
- Three Redux store methods provided by createStore are getState() (used to retrieve the current state from the store), dispatch(action) (used to trigger an action to modify the state), and subscribe(listener) (used to register a callback function that gets invoked whenever the state changes, often to update the UI in response to state changes).

4. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.
- combineReducers() is a function in Redux that allows you to combine multiple smaller reducer functions into a single reducer, making it easier to manage and organize state logic in a large application, and it's useful because it promotes modularity and maintainability in state management.
