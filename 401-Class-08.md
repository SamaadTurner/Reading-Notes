# 5 Steps to RBAC   
-RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization.  
- A lot of company data breaches have happened because of silly mistakes, like accessing a companys personal network from a coffee shop.  
- What RBAC would do is group employees based on the status in the company and give them certain privileges pertaining to their roles. For an example, a CEO of that company more than likely would have some if not all the access privileges over someone like the janitor or just a regular employee.  
- First step is to Inventory the systems within the company. Figure out what resources the company has and figure out the need to control them. Ex: an email system, customer database, contact management system, or even major folders on a file server.  
- Second step is to Analyze the workforce and create roles within that company.  
- Third step is to assign roles to people. Figure out which roles each employee belongs to and give access rights according to that.  
- The fourth step is to never make one-off changes. This means you should really try not to make a one-off change for an employee with unusual needs. Instead change the roles as required or add new ones when absolutely necessary.    
- The fifth and final step is to Audit. Periodically review the roles, the eomployees, and the access rights given.  

## Questions:  

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
- RBAC is a system for controlling who can access what in a computer system by assigning roles with specific permissions, which is crucial for security and access management.
  
2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.  
-An "Admin," "Manager," and "User," where "Admin" has the highest level of permissions, followed by "Manager," and "User" with the least permissions.   

3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
- Inventory the systems, analyze the workforce and create roles within the company, assign roles to people, never make one-off changes, and Audit everything ive put in place.


# Wiki RBAC:  
- According to wiki, Role-based access control is a policy-neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.
- The design of it is basically setting permissions to perform certain operations to specifc roles.

## Questions:  
1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?  
- The process of determining and granting specific permissions and access rights to authenticated users or entities based on their roles or attributes.  
2.Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.  
-Role assignment, Role permission, and Role activation.
3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
-RBAC is like assigning different access levels or permissions to people in a club, where each person gets a specific badge (role) that lets them do certain things, ensuring that everyone only does what they're supposed to do.

# Video Questions  
1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
- Primarily it is associated with the role. Users gain access rights based on their assigned roles in the company. This ensures that users with the same role have the same permissions and this helps with the idea of access management.
2.Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?  
- After a user authenticates themselves.  
3.Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.  
-RBAC benefits a business by improving security, simplifying access management, and ensuring compliance through structured role-based permissions.
