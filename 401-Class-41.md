# Getting started with React Native  
1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.  

React Native is a popular open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Three core components of React Native include:  

React Native Components:  

React Native provides a set of pre-built, native components that map to their native counterparts on iOS and Android platforms. Examples include View, Text, Image, ScrollView, and more. These components allow developers to create a user interface that looks and feels like a native app, ensuring a consistent and familiar experience for users on both platforms.  
React Native API Libraries:  

React Native exposes a set of JavaScript APIs that give developers access to native device features and functionalities. These APIs cover a wide range of capabilities, such as handling gestures, accessing the camera, working with device sensors, and interacting with platform-specific APIs. By using these APIs, developers can access native functionality without having to write separate code for iOS and Android, promoting code reusability.  
JavaScript (React) and Native Bridge:  

React Native relies on a bridge that enables communication between JavaScript code and native code. The JavaScript code runs in a JavaScript engine embedded within the app, while the native code interacts with the underlying device APIs. This bridge allows developers to write most of the code in JavaScript, which is then translated into native code when the app runs. This approach allows for cross-platform development with a single codebase while still providing access to native capabilities.  

2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
- React Native solves the problem of having to develop separate codebases for different mobile platforms (iOS and Android) when building mobile applications. The term "native" in React Native refers to the fact that the framework allows developers to build mobile apps using the same fundamental building blocks as native apps written in Swift/Obj-C for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android.

3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
- The building blocks of a React Native app are similar to those of a React app, as both frameworks share the same fundamental concepts provided by React. However, there are key differences in how these building blocks are implemented and interact with the underlying platform. While React and React Native share these core concepts, the implementation details differ to accommodate the specific requirements and differences between building web applications and mobile apps. React Native's focus is on bridging JavaScript code to native components, ensuring a native user experience on mobile devices.

# Expo  
1. What solution does expo provide?
- Expo provides a framework and set of tools that simplifies and accelerates the development of React Native applications by offering a pre-configured development environment, a collection of pre-built components and modules, and streamlined workflows for building and deploying mobile apps.
2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
- managed
3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
- React Native is a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications, while Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native that aims to simplify and accelerate the development process by providing a higher-level abstraction and additional features.

# Expo Snack  
1. What does snack allow you to do?
- Expo Snack allows you to quickly prototype, develop, and share React Native applications directly in your web browser, without the need for local development setup, by providing an online code editor and simulator environment.

# Ejecting  
1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?
- "eject" refers to the process of transitioning a React Native project from the Expo-managed workflow to the bare workflow, granting more control over the native code and dependencies but requiring manual configuration and management.
2. When should you not eject?
- You should not eject from Expo if you prefer to maintain the simplicity and ease of development provided by the managed workflow and do not require extensive customization of native modules or configurations.
3. Why might you choose to eject?  
- You might choose to eject from Expo if you need more control over the native modules, dependencies, or configurations in your React Native project, allowing for greater customization and integration with native code.
