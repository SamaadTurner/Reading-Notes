# Multiple Reducers Example
1. Why create multiple reducers?
- Multiple reducers are created in Redux to manage different parts of the application's state independently, making it more modular and maintainable, and allowing for better separation of concerns in the application's logic.
2. How would you combine multiple reducers?
- Multiple reducers are combined in Redux using the combineReducers function, which creates a single reducer that delegates actions to the respective individual reducers based on their specified slice of the state.
3. How will you manage state as an immutable object? why?
- State is managed as an immutable object in many state management systems, such as Redux, to ensure predictability and traceability of changes, preventing unexpected side effects and simplifying debugging and testing by making it clear when and where state modifications occur.

1. combineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing ___ _____ .
- combineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers.
2. Explain how combineReducers assembles the new state tree.
- combineReducers assembles the new state tree by creating an object with the same shape as the input reducers, where each key corresponds to a slice of the state and the values are the results of calling the corresponding reducer functions with their slice of the state and the current action.
3. How would you define initial state in an app using combineReducers?
- In an app using combineReducers, you would define the initial state for each reducer using the initialState parameter when creating the reducer, typically as an object where each key corresponds to a slice of the state and its initial value.

1. Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?
- You would want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex to maintain a modular and organized codebase, enabling different developers to work on separate parts of the application's state management and reducing the risk of conflicts and bugs.
2. The _____ helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to ____.
- combineReducers
3. What is a popular convention when naming reducers?
  - A popular convention when naming reducers is to use the same name for the state slice they manage, making it clear which part of the state they handle, for example, "counter" for a counter reducer.
