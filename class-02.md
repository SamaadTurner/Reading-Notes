# Introduction to HTML  

This topic is very important because this whole module has a lot to do with HTML and understanding it is very important.  

What is HTML? 

In a nutshell, HTML is a the standrd language used to create web pages. It provides the foundation for displaying content on the internet, allowing browsers to interpret and render the structure, layout, and media of the webpage.  

## What is the HEAD of an HTML document? 

The head is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded.  
It also contains the info like the &lt;title>, links to customize favicons, and metadata.  
Metadata is data that describes data. For example, an HTML document is data, but HTML can also contain metadata in its "&lt;head>" element that describes the document - for example who wrote it, and its summary.  



## HTML text fundamentals  

One of the many jobs for HTML is to give text meaning (which is called semantics) so that the browswer knows how to display it correctly.  
In HTML, each PARAGRAPH has to be wrapped in a "&lt;p> element.  
Ex: &lt;p> This is how to do a paragraph...&lt;/p>.  
Every HEADING must be wrapped in a heading element.  
Ex: &lt;h1>I am the heading.&lt;/h1>.  


## Creating hyperlinks  

Hyperlinks (or called links) are an essential feature in HTML. They are used to navigate between different web pages and resources on the internet.  
Hyperlinks are created using the "&lt;a>" tags. The "&lt;href" attribute is used to specify the destination URL of the link. 
To write a very basic link, you must wrap the text or contents inside a &lt;a> element and use the href attribute for the web address.  
Ex: &lt;p>  
Im creating a link to  
&lt;a href="URL LINK HERE:>the URL LINK HERE homepage &lt;/a>.  
&lt;/p>.  

## Advanced text formatting  

There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text...    
Here are a few: inline quotations, citations, description lists, multiple descriptions for one term, etc.  

## Document and website structure  

Basic sections include a header, navigtion bar, main content, sidebar, and a footer.  
If I wanted to see a basic way to set up an html document, I can google "html5 boiler template".  

## Debugging HTML  

All in all, HTML is not a hard language to find syntax o logical errors. When in doubt, ask ChatGPT if there are any errors.

# Learn CSS

# Learn JS

It is more complex than HTML and CSS.

## Questions  

1. In JavaScript, an if statement checks a condition, and if it evaluates to true, then the code block associated with the if statement will execute.
2.  This construct is useful when you have multiple mutually exclusive conditions and want to execute different blocks of code based on the outcome of each condition.
3.  ==, !=, >.
4.  "&&" returns true if both conditions on the left and right side of the operator are true. "||" Returns true if at least one of the conditions on the left or right side of the operator is true.
