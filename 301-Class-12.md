# Which HTTP Status Code to Use for Every CRUD App  
-A status code is a number higher than 100 and smaller than 600 that is part of a HTTP response. The first digit defines the class of the status.  

# Status Classes  
-If we understand the class a status code is in, we can locate problems more quickly.  

## 100 - 199  
- These are informational status codes; they usually tell the client that the header that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client.
## 200-299  
-These are the success codes. They tell the client that its request was accepted. In case of asynchronous processing of a request (202), this doesnt mean the request was successful processed only that it met all validation requirements at the time of sending.  
## 300-399  
-These are redirection codes. They tell the client that the resources they are requesting isnt available at the expected location anymore. This can have mulitple reasons, be temporary or permanent, but the client has to issue a request to the new location.  

## 400-499  
-These are the client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server. There are several causes to this, timeouts, wrong URL, missing authentication, etc. A client is sending incorrect input and should confirm the input parameters are correct before retying the request.  

1. In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
-100's = inform the client that the server has received the request header and intends to fulfill the client's transmission requirements, potentially involving protocol changes or warning of request failure before data transmission begins.   
-200's = These success codes indicate to the client that its request was accepted; however, in cases of asynchronous processing (202), this doesn't guarantee immediate successful processing, only meeting initial validation requirements.  
-300's = These redirection codes inform the client that the requested resource has been moved from the expected location, prompting the client to issue a request to the new location due to various reasons, either temporary or permanent.  
-400's = These client error codes indicate invalid requests from a client to a server due to various reasons such as timeouts, incorrect URIs, missing authentication; clients should verify input parameters before attempting a request again.  
-500's = These server error codes typically signify issues with server overload, proxy-related unavailability, or client-triggered exceptions, which can be temporary or permanent, suggesting that the client may retry the same request.

2. What is a status code 202?
-indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, often in an asynchronous manner, and doesn't imply immediate successful completion.

3.What is a status code 308?  
-signifies a permanent redirect, indicating that the resource requested has moved to a different location and clients should update their request to the new URL.  

4.What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?  
-You would use the "204 No Content" status code.  

5.What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?  
-410 Gone status  

6. What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?  
-HTTP 403 indicates that the server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.

1.Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env  
-Separate sensitive configuration details from the source code  
2.What is middleware?  
refers to software components that intercept and process requests and responses in a web application, allowing for tasks such as authentication, logging, and data manipulation to be performed before reaching the final handler.  
3.What does app.use(express.json()) do?  
-an Express.js application that parses incoming JSON data from requests, making it accessible as a JavaScript object in the req.body property.  
4.What does the /:id mean in a route?
-represents a parameter placeholder that can capture a dynamic value (such as an identifier) from the URL, allowing the server to handle requests based on that specific value.  

5.What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?  
-The main difference between PUT and PATCH is that PUT replaces the entire resource with the new representation provided, while PATCH partially updates the resource with the changes specified.  

6.How do you make a default value in a schema?  
-Use the default property when defining a field, providing the desired default value.

7.What does a 500 error status code mean?  
- indicates an internal server error, signifying that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.  

8.What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?  
-indicates a successful request, while a status code 201 indicates that a new resource has been successfully created as a result of the request.
