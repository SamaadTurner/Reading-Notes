# Functional Programming Concept  
*DID NOT HAVE ACCESS*  
## Questions  
1. What is functional programming?
-programming paradigm focused on treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, emphasizing immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions to manage and manipulate data.
2.What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
-A pure function is a function that always produces the same output for a given input, without any side effects, ensuring determinism; it doesn't modify external state or rely on it, making it testable and predictable.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
-What are the benefits of a pure function?
4.What is immutability?
- property of data or objects that prevents them from being modified after they are created, ensuring stability and predictability in programming.
5.What is Referential transparency?
-concept that a function's output is solely determined by its input, allowing for substitution of function calls with their results without affecting the program's behavior.

## Questions  
1.What is a module?  
-self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functions, classes, and variables, aiding in code organization, separation of concerns, and reusability in programming.  
2.What does the word ‘require’ do?  
-import external modules or files, making their functionality and exports available for use within the current module.  
3.How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?  
-import or require
4.What do we have to do to make a module available?  
-you need to export its functions, variables, or classes so that they can be imported and used in other parts of your code.
