# Thinking in React:  
- When you build a UI with react, you break the whole thing up in pieces called components.
- Then you describe the different visual states for each of yours componets.
  
## JSON API and mockup available:  
- JSON API provides data for the UI.  
- Mockup outlines the visual design.
  
## UI Implementation Steps:
Component Hierarchy:
-Divide UI into components, matching data structure.
-Identify components' responsibilities.

## Build Static Version:
- Construct a non-interactive UI using components.
- Reuse components and pass data through props.
  
## UI State Representation:
-Determine changing data needed for interaction.
-Keep state minimal and DRY.
-Identify which data should be state.

## Identify State's Location:
-Find components using state.
-Locate common parent component.
-Decide where state should reside.

## Add Inverse Data Flow:
-Support user input updating the state.
-Pass state-changing functions to child components.

## Components:
-FilterableProductTable: Top-level app component.
-SearchBar: Receives user input for filtering.
-ProductTable: Displays and filters product list.
-ProductCategoryRow: Displays category headings.
-ProductRow: Displays individual product rows.

## State Handling:
-State involves search text and checkbox value.
-Initial state set using useState Hook.
-State changes passed to child components as props.

## User Interaction:
-Input and checkbox values in SearchBar.
-Input onChange event updates state.
-State changes trigger UI updates.
-This process results in a functional React app that allows users to interact with the UI and filters product data based on their input.

## Questions:  
1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?  
-The single responsibility principle states that a component should have only one specific purpose or functionality, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code by avoiding complex and intertwined responsibilities within components.  
2.What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?  
-creating a representation of the user interface that renders the data model without incorporating interactivity, serving as a foundational step before adding dynamic behavior.  
3.Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
-functionality
4.What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
-Does it stay unchanged over time?  
-Is it is passed from a parent via props?
-Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component?  
5.How can you identify where state needs to live?
-You can identify where state needs to live by identifying the components that use the state, finding their closest common parent component, and deciding whether to place the state in that common parent or in a higher-level component.

# High-Order Functions:  

## Boasting About Code Size  
Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu's discussion about code size.  
Master Yuan-Ma's insight about keeping code simple.  

## Complexity and Bugs  
Larger programs tend to be more complex and confusing.  
Complexity leads to programmer mistakes (bugs).  

## Expressing Solutions Clearly  
Example programs: simple vs. complex solutions.  
The importance of using a vocabulary that matches the problem being solved.  

## Abstraction:  
Vocabulary in programming as abstractions.
Abstractions simplify complex details and allow higher-level discussions.

## Abstraction Examples:  
Recipe analogy: detailed vs. concise cooking instructions.
Writing code at an appropriate level of abstraction.

## Plain Functions and Abstractions  

Plain functions help build abstractions.  
Using plain functions to create abstractions for repetitive tasks. 

## Abstracting Repetition  
Using loops to repeat actions.  
Abstracting "doing something N times" as a function.  
Passing actions as function values.

## Higher-Order Functions:  
Functions that operate on other functions.  
Creating new functions or changing existing ones.  

## Creating New Functions:  
Creating functions that return functions.  
Example: greaterThan function.  

## Changing Functions
Modifying functions using other functions.  
Example: noisy function.  

## Controlling Flow  
Creating functions for new control flow.  
Example: unless function.  

## Higher-Order Functions in Arrays:  
Using forEach as a higher-order function.  
Applying a function to each element of an array.  

## Data Processing with Higher-Order Functions:  

Using higher-order functions for data processing.
Example: Processing a data set about scripts.

## Unicode and Writing Systems:  
Unicode assigns numbers to characters in written languages.  
Different scripts and writing systems defined by Unicode.

## Filtering Arrays:  
Using the filter function to extract specific elements.  
Example: Filtering living scripts from a data set.  

## Transforming with Map:
Using the map function to transform array elements.  
Example: Transforming script names.  

## Summarizing with Reduce:  
Using the reduce function to compute a single value.  
Example: Finding the script with the most characters.  

## Strings and Character Codes:  
JavaScript strings encoded as 16-bit code units.  
UTF-16 encoding and its issues.  
Using the for/of loop with strings to handle characters. 

## Recognizing Text:  
Using characterScript function to identify script of a character.  
Using higher-order functions to count characters by script. 

## CountBy Abstraction:  
Creating an abstraction to count elements by group.  
Example: Counting elements based on a test function. 

## TextScripts Function:
Function to determine the scripts used in a piece of text.  
Using countBy and higher-order functions for computation.  

## Exercises
Flattening arrays using reduce and concat.  
Implementing a custom loop function.  
Implementing the every function using a loop and some.  
Creating a function to compute the dominant writing direction in a string.  

## Questions:  
1.What is a “higher-order function”?  
- a function that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as its result.  
2.Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?  
- returning an anonymous function that takes a parameter m and returns a boolean value indicating whether m is greater than the value n that was passed to the outer greaterThan function.  
3.Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.  
-Map and reduce are higher-order functions that operate on arrays: map transforms each element of an array using a given function and returns a new array, while reduce accumulates a single value by applying a combining function to each element of the array successively.
