# Introduction to JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
- A JSON Web Token is  a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims that are in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that are issued as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON WebEncryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encryption.
- In summary, a JWT just defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- It is digitally signed using a secret (or public) key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
- Ex Web token: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz   

  
## When should they be used?  
- When you are wanting to do Authorization or even Information Exchange to name two.

The Structure of a JSON Web Token includes:  
- A header: Usually consists of two parts, the type of the token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used (like HMAC SHA256 or RSA).
  Ex:
  {  
  "alg": "HS256",  
  "typ": "JWT"
  }
  
- A Payload: Is the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (the USER) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private.  
  Ex:
  {  
  "sub": "1234567890",  
  "name": "John Doe",  
  "admin": true  

}    
- A Signature: To create a signature, you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in header THEN sign that.  
  Ex:

  HMACSHA256(  
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +  
  base64UrlEncode(payload),  
  secret)

  ## Questions:

  1.What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
  - A JSON Web Token is  a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.  
  2.When should we use JSON Web Tokens?
  - When you are wanting to authorize something or information exchange.  
  3.Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?
  - Payload.
 

  ## Stack Overflow Questions:

1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?
- Just because you decode it, doesnt make the JWT itself secure. They arent designed to be a secret, but verifiable. The signature and validation process is what makes it secure.
2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.
- the hash( payload + secret).
3.Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.
- by using encryption to protect the combined data, ensuring that only the intended recipient with the decryption key can access the original content and secret.

## Video question  

1. Why use JWT?
- To authenticate or send info between two things.
  
2.JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend.  
-  it's like a sealed, easy-to-carry envelope containing all the necessary information, making it simple for websites and apps to share data securely without repeatedly asking for a password or checking with a central authority.
  
3. What are the three components (the structure) of a JWT signature?
- Header, Payload, and Signature (secret key which can be private or public).
