# Async Actions  

1. Why use Redux middleware?
- Redux middleware is used to handle side effects, such as making asynchronous API calls and dispatching additional actions, while maintaining the purity and predictability of Redux's data flow.

2. Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.
- The Redux Async Data Flow Diagram represents the process where a user event triggers a dispatch, middleware can execute asynchronous logic like making AJAX requests, and upon completion, an action is dispatched to update the state, allowing the UI to reflect the changes.

3. How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?  
- We are accommodating async operations in our Redux app by using thunks, which are functions that encapsulate asynchronous logic and are dispatched to handle data fetching and other side effects, keeping the data flow predictable and pure.

# Thunks Middleware  
1. Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?
- Redux Thunk middleware is needed to handle asynchronous actions in Redux, allowing you to dispatch functions that can perform async operations, such as API calls, and then dispatch regular actions once those operations are complete.

2. Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.
- function

3. Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.
- Any return value from the inner thunk function can be accessed using the await keyword or .then() when dispatching the thunk function.

# Reflection  
- Get better at redux in general!
