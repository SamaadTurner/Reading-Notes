# React Docs - Forms:

Controlled Components: HTML form elements like &lt;input>, &lt;textarea>, and &lt;select> maintain their values in React's state instead of their own internal state.  
Single Source of Truth: React's state becomes the "single source of truth" for form element values, allowing components to control what happens in the form based on user input.  
Event Handlers: Event handlers such as handleChange are used to update the state when the user interacts with form elements.  
Rendering Value: Form elements use the value attribute to display the value from the React state. User input triggers updates to the state.  
Preventing Default Behavior: Event handlers like handleSubmit can prevent the default behavior of form submission (navigating to a new page).  
&lt;textarea> and &lt;select>: Similar to &lt;input>, &lt;textarea> and &lt;select> elements are also controlled components in React, utilizing the value attribute and event handlers for user input.  
Handling Multiple Inputs: For managing multiple controlled input elements, the name attribute is used along with event handlers to determine which part of the state to update.  
Computed Property Names: ES6 computed property name syntax can be used to update state properties dynamically based on the input's name.  
Alternatives: While controlled components offer precise control, they can be cumbersome, especially for complex forms. Uncontrolled components are an alternative approach where form elements handle their own state.  
Formik: For more advanced form handling, libraries like Formik provide complete solutions for form validation, submission, and field tracking, while still adhering to the controlled component principles.  

## Questions:

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?  
-It is a form element whose value and behavior are managed by React state, enabling centralized control and synchronization of user input.
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
-It's better to update the state with the user's responses as soon as they enter them, as it allows for real-time interaction, validation, and manipulation of the form data, providing a smoother user experience.
3.How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
-event.target.value.

# Ternary Operators:
Introduction: The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write conditional expressions in programming.  

Syntax: The basic syntax of the ternary operator is: condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse  

Condition: The condition is an expression that evaluates to either true or false.  

Execution Flow: The ternary operator works by evaluating the condition. If it's true, the expression returns valueIfTrue, otherwise, it returns valueIfFalse.  

Use Case: It's commonly used as a shorthand for simple if-else statements, allowing you to write a conditional expression in a single line of code.  

Example 1: Consider age >= 18 ? 'Adult' : 'Minor'. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, it returns 'Adult', otherwise 'Minor'.  

Example 2: Another example: isStudent ? 'Student' : 'Not a student'. If isStudent is true, it returns 'Student', otherwise 'Not a student'.  

Nested Ternaries: Ternaries can be nested to handle more complex conditions. For example: grade >= 90 ? 'A' : grade >= 80 ? 'B' : 'C'. This returns 'A' for grades above 90, 'B' for grades above 80, and 'C' otherwise.  

Chaining Operations: The ternary operator allows you to perform multiple operations within the expressions. For instance:  

let price = isStudent ? (discount = 0.2, 100 - (100 * discount)) : 100;  
This sets the price to 80 (20% discount) if isStudent is true, otherwise, it's set to 100.  

Readability: While ternaries can make code more concise, excessive nesting or complex expressions can reduce code readability. It's best used for simple conditions to maintain code clarity.  

In summary, the ternary operator offers a succinct way to write conditional expressions in programming, evaluating a condition and returning different values based on its truthiness. It's commonly used for simple branching logic to enhance code readability and maintainability.    

## Questions:  
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?   
-We would use a ternary operator to write concise conditional expressions that make code more readable and reduce the need for verbose if-else statements for simple conditions.  
2. Statement rewritten:  
console.log(x === y ? true : false);
