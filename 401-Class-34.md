# Dynamic API Server  
- In a dynamc API Server, the server must support all REST/HTTP methods, obey a standard routing structure, and also obey a standard output format.

## Questions:  

1. Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.  
- A query string parameter is appended to a URL and provides additional information to a resource, while a path parameter is part of the URL's path and is used to identify a specific resource or endpoint.

2. What would our API URL be?
- http://our-site.com/api/v3/stuff/things

3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.
- Imagine our dynamic API with an "interface" as a remote control with buttons that let you interact with a computer system, like changing TV channels using a remote control.

# Review Auth Server Build  

- Designed to handle user registration and sign in using Basic, Bearer, or OAuth along with a custom “authorization” module that will grant/deny users access to the server based on their role or permissions level.

## Questions:  

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.
- Middleware can be used to implement basic authentication by checking a user's username and password, or bearer authentication by validating a token provided by the user, before allowing access to a web application.

2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.
- To implement OAuth, there is a handshake between a user, a third-party application, and a service provider to securely grant the application access to the user's data without revealing their login credentials.

3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.
- Role-Based Access Control is like assigning different levels of access in a video game, where each player has a specific role determining what they can and cannot do within the game, ensuring that only authorized actions are performed by each player.
