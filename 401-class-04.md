# SQL vs NoSQL  

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); NoSQL databses are primarily called non-relational or distributed database.  
## NoSQL Databases:
- Document-based, key-value pairs, graph, or wide-column stores.   
- Have a dynamic schema (schema-less) for unstructured data.  
- Horizontally scalable (scaling by adding more servers).  
- Use various query languages depending on the database type.  
- Examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDb.  
- Not ideal for complex queries; queries are focused on collections/documents.  
- Suitable for hierarchical data and large datasets (e.g., big data).  
- Emphasize Brewer's CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance).  
- Often rely on community support and fewer experts for large-scale deployments.  
- Classified into various types: graph, key-value store, document store, column store, XML databases.
## SQL Databases  
- Table-based databases.  
- Have a predefined schema.  
- Vertically scalable (scaling by increasing hardware resources).  
- Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for data definition and manipulation.  
- Examples: MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MS-SQL.  
- Good for complex queries and transactional applications.  
- Suitable for structured data.  
- Emphasize ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).  
- Available from both open-source and commercial vendors.

## Questions:  
1.What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?  
-SQL
2.What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?  
-NoSQL  
3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.  
- SQL databases are like traditional libraries with strict organization, while NoSQL databases are more like free-form bookshelves that can handle lots of different books but may become disorganized as they grow.


# SQL Modeling  
- MySQL workbench creates smart looking diagrams, but also generates the code to create the database.

## Questions
1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?
- A one-to-many relationship between data tables means that for each record in one table, there can be multiple related records in another table, typically established by using a foreign key in the "many" table to reference the primary key in the "one" table.
2.Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.
-create a diagram
3.Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.
- A primary key uniquely identifies a record within a database table, while a foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referring to the primary key of another table.

# Video Questions:  
1.How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?  
-Keywords are predefined words in SQL with specific meanings, while parameters are values that can be substituted into SQL queries to make them adaptable to various situations or user input.  
2.Define normalization within the context of schemas and data. 
-Normalization in the context of schemas and data is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by breaking down tables into smaller, related tables and ensuring that data is stored efficiently.  
3.Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.  
-A one-to-one relationship is like having one passport for one person, a one-to-many relationship is like one person having multiple phone numbers, and a many-to-many relationship is like multiple people attending multiple events where each person can attend multiple events, and each event can have multiple attendees.
