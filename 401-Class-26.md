# React 
- React apss are made up of components.
- A component is a piece of the UI that has it own logic and appearance. A component has no size. It can be as small as a button or as big an enire page.
## Questions  
1. The building blocks of a React app are components, which are reusable, self-contained units of the user interface.  
2. An HTML element is a fundamental part of a web page, while a React component is a reusable and self-contained piece of the user interface that can be composed of multiple HTML elements.  
3. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and work with React components.  
4. JavaScript expressions can be embedded in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces, like {expression}.  
5. React provides features like the map method for iteration and conditional rendering using ternary operators or if statements within JSX.  
6. React responds to user inputs through event handlers and state updates, causing components to re-render when the state changes.  
7. The word "useState" indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook.  
8. Two React components can share data by lifting the state to a common ancestor component, using props to pass data down, or by employing a state management library like Redux.

# Render and Commit  
- 3 steps scenario:  
1. Triggering a render (delivering the guestâ€™s order to the kitchen)  
2.Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)  
3. Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table

1. What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?  
- The three steps of refreshing a React UI involve the following: changing the component's state, triggering a re-render, and updating the user interface with the new data.  
2. How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?  
- Updates to a component after the initial render are triggered by modifying the component's state using methods like setState or by receiving new props.  
3.Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?
- No, React does not recreate DOM nodes on every rerender; it updates and reconciles the virtual DOM to minimize changes to the actual DOM, which helps improve performance.  
4. After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?
- Before the user sees the change, the browser needs to repaint and reflow the updated DOM, ensuring the visual updates become visible.

# Additional Questions:  
1. Patterns i see is that every import has to start with the word 'import'.
2. I look forward to learning more about React.
3. Be a better coder.
