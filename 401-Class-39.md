# Redux Toolkit (RTK)  
1. What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?
- Redux Toolkit addresses concerns related to simplifying the development of Redux-based applications by providing utilities for managing state, reducing boilerplate code, and improving developer productivity.
2. What does configureStore() do?
- configureStore() is a function in Redux Toolkit that creates a Redux store with predefined settings and middleware, making it easier to set up and manage the store in a Redux-based application.
3. How would I use createSlice()?
- You would use createSlice() from Redux Toolkit to define a slice of the Redux store, including its initial state, reducers, and actions, simplifying the process of managing state in a Redux application.

# MobX  
1. What is Mobx?
- MobX is a state management library for JavaScript applications, particularly well-suited for building reactive and scalable user interfaces by automatically tracking and updating data changes.
2. How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?
- MobX ensures consistency by making it "impossible" to produce an inconsistent state through its observables and reactions, which automatically synchronize and update data whenever it is accessed or modified.
3. How would we build a reactive user interface?
- To build a reactive user interface, you would use a library like MobX to automatically update the UI in response to changes in the underlying data, creating a seamless and responsive user experience.
