# AWS API Gateway Overview  

- API sits between the backend services of your API aND YOUR api's users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoint and routing them to the correct backends.
- API Gateway intergrates with many other AWS Service like AWS Lambda, AWS SNS, AWS IAM, and Cognito Idenity Pools.

## Why is API Gateway an essential part of the Severless Ecosystem?  

- It is the piece that ties together Severless functions and API definitions. Being able to trigger the execution of a Severless function directly in response to an HTTP request is the key reason why API Gateway is so valuable in Severless setups.
- When using API Gateway together with AWS services, you can potentially build a fully functional customer-facing web app without mainting a single server yourself.
- the advantages of the severless model are: scalability, low maintenance, and low cost due to low overhead-to mainstream web aopplications.

## Questions:  
1. What is Amazon API Gateway?
- a fully managed service by AWS that enables developers to create, publish, and manage APIs for their applications, allowing seamless integration with various AWS services and external resources.
  
2. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?
-  it provides a scalable and cost-effective way to manage and expose APIs for serverless applications, facilitating efficient communication between clients and serverless functions without the need to manage traditional server infrastructure.
 
3. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?
- by providing a straightforward way to connect and proxy requests to these services, enabling seamless interaction with services like AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and more through the creation of API methods and integration configurations.

# AWS API Gateway  
- Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
- using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.
-Benefits: Efficient API development, Performance at any scale, Cost saving at scale, easy monitoring, flexible security controls RESTful API options.  

## API Types
- RESTful APIs: a type of web service that adhere to a set of architectural constraints, allowing client applications to interact with server resources using standard HTTP methods and stateless communication.  
- WEBSOCKET APIs:  a communication protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time data transfer between a client and a server, making them well-suited for applications requiring low-latency, interactive, and continuous data updates.

# AWS DynamoDB Guide  
- DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- Good for: Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements, Severless applications using AWS Lambda, Data sets with simple, and known access patterns.

## Questions:  

1. What is DynamoDB?
-  a fully managed NoSQL database service by AWS that provides high availability, scalability, and low-latency performance for applications requiring flexible and seamless storage of structured data.
2. Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?
- hen you need a fully managed, highly scalable, and low-latency NoSQL database service with seamless integration into the AWS ecosystem, suitable for applications with variable workloads and global reach.
3. Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.
- Think of DynamoDB like a super-fast and infinitely expandable digital filing cabinet in the cloud where you can store, retrieve, and organize information for your apps without worrying about the cabinet getting too full or slow.

# Dynamoose  

- it is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familiar.

 ## Questions  
1. What is Dynamoose?
- a JavaScript library that simplifies working with Amazon DynamoDB, making it easier for developers to interact with the DynamoDB database using a more user-friendly and intuitive interface.
2. What are some key features of Dynamoose?
-Type safety, easy to use syntax, High level API, and the ability to transform data before saving or retrieving items.
