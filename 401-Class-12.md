# WebSocket  
- A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex, bidirectional communication channels over a single TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection.  
- Key characteristics:  
* Enable simultaneous two-way communication, meaning both the client and server can send messages to each other independently without waiting for a request-response cycle.  
* They are designed for low-latency communication, making them suitable for real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, etc.  
* WebSocket Handshake to establish a connection  
## Questions:  
1. What is a Web Socket?
- A WebSocket is a protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time communication between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server over a single TCP connection.
2.Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
-The WebSocket request/response handshake is an initial HTTP-based exchange between a client and server to negotiate and establish a WebSocket connection, and once the connection is established, both parties can send and receive data in real-time through a persistent, full-duplex channel without the need for repeated handshakes.
3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.  
- HTTP request

# WebSocket vs Socket.io  

- WebSocket is the communication Protocol that provides a bidirectional communication between the client and the server over a TCP connection.
- Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the client and the web servers.
  
Socket.io:  
- a higher-level library built on top of WebSocket (or other transport technologies like long polling) that provides an abstraction for real-time communication.
- It is JavaScript-centric and designed primarily for use with Node.js on the server and JavaScript in web browsers.
- Socket.io offers a range of features out of the box, including broadcasting, rooms (grouping clients), and automatic reconnection, making it easier to build complex real-time applications.  

Key differences:  

WebSocket is a low-level, standardized protocol for real-time communication, while Socket.io is a higher-level library built on top of WebSocket (or other transports) that offers a more user-friendly API with additional features. The choice between them depends on your specific use case, development language, and the level of control and features you require for your real-time application.  

## Questions:  
1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).
- WebSocket is a standardized protocol for real-time communication, while Socket.IO is a higher-level library built on top of WebSocket (or other transport technologies) that provides a more user-friendly API with added features for real-time applications, akin to the difference between Git and GitHub or OAuth and Auth0.
2. When would you use Socket.IO?
- When you need a high-level, easy-to-use library for real-time communication in web applications.
3. When would you use WebSocket?  
-hen you need a low-level, standardized protocol for real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and server.


# OSI Video:  
- The Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or networking system into seven distinct layers, from the physical connection to the application layer.
- Physical Layer: Responsible for the physical medium and electrical/optical signals. Concerned with the transmission and reception of raw data bits over a physical medium (cables, wireless signals, etcs.)
- Data Link Layer: Manages data framing, error detection, and media access control addressing. Ensure reliable point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication over the physical layer.
* More layers (look up if needed).

# TCP Video:  
TCP is like a super careful postal service for data on the internet. It ensures that your data gets to its destination intact and in the right order, even if some parts need to be sent multiple times.  

# Reflection
- Get better at coding.
