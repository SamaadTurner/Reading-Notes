# Thinking in React:  
Break the UI into a Component Hierarchy:  

Divide the UI into components and subcomponents, naming them.  
Consider principles like the single responsibility principle, which suggests that components should ideally perform a single task.  
Organize components based on your data model, ensuring a one-to-one mapping.  
Build a Static Version in React:  

Create a static version of your app that renders the UI from your data model without adding interactivity.  
Build components that reuse other components and pass data using props.  
Avoid using state in this stage, as it's reserved for interactivity.  
Find the Minimal but Complete Representation of UI State:  

Identify the minimal set of changing data (state) that your app needs to remember.  
Ensure that your state is not repeated and can be computed based on existing state or props.  
In your example, the search text and checkbox values are identified as state.  
Identify Where Your State Should Live:  

Determine which component should own each piece of state.  
Find the common parent component for components that render something based on the state.  
Decide where the state should live, often in the common parent component.  
Add Inverse Data Flow:  

Support data flowing from form components to update the state in the parent component.  
Pass state-changing functions (e.g., setFilterText and setInStockOnly) as props from the parent component to child components.  
Add onChange event handlers in child components to update the state in the parent component.  
## Question:  
1. Summarize the five steps of thinking in react.
- The five steps of thinking in React involve breaking the UI into a component hierarchy, building a static version, identifying the minimal state representation, determining where state should live, and enabling inverse data flow for interactivity and state updates.

# State: A Component's Memory:  

In React, components often require the ability to remember and update information in response to interactions, such as changing input values, image displays, or shopping cart contents, which is achieved through component-specific memory referred to as "state."  

## Queations:  
1. What is one reason local variable isnt sufficient for managing a React component?
- Local variables aren't sufficient for managing a React component because they don't trigger re-renders or provide a way to handle component-specific state changes.
2. What is the argument to the useState hook, and what are the two parts of its return array?
- The argument to the useState hook is the initial state value, and the two parts of its return array are the current state value and a function to update the state.
3. How can Component A access state from Component B?
- by passing the state data as props from Component B to Component A, allowing Component A to read and use that data.
