# RESTful web API design  
-Modern web applications have APIs for client interaction.  
-A well-designed web API should support:
-Platform independence using standard protocols.  
-Service evolution without breaking existing clients.  
-Discoverable functionality for full client use.  
-REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for web services.  
-REST is not tied to any protocol, often uses HTTP.  
-Advantages of REST: open standards, flexible implementation.  
-Design principles for RESTful APIs using HTTP:
-Designed around resources with identifiers (URIs).  
-Clients exchange representations of resources (often JSON).  
-Uniform interface with standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).  
-Stateless request model, no transient state.  
-Driven by hypermedia links in representations.  
-Leonard Richardson's maturity model for web APIs:
-Level 0 to 3, with Level 3 being truly RESTful.  
-Organize API design around resources, focus on business entities.  
-Use consistent naming conventions for URIs, prefer nouns over verbs.  
-Collections (e.g, orders, customers) have separate URIs.  
-Keep client internal details hidden, model entities and operations.  
-Group entities into collections with distinct URIs.  
-Follow hierarchy for intuitive URIs, use plural nouns.  
-Relationships between resources can be navigated via links.  
-Avoid overly complex URIs for relationships, keep them simple.  
-Consider performance, avoid chatty APIs, denormalize data if needed.  
-Avoid tight coupling between API and data sources.  
-Non-resource scenarios can use HTTP requests for functions.  
-Define API operations using common HTTP methods:
-GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.  
-Requests' effect depends on whether resource is a collection or item.  

## Questions:  
1. What does REST stand for?
-Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for designing networked applications
2.REST APIs are designed around a ____.
-resource
3.What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.  
-An identifier of a resource is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that uniquely identifies that resource, such as https://example.com/orders/1 for a specific customer order.
4.What are the most common HTTP verbs?
- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
5.What should the URLs be based on?
-URLs should be based on nouns, representing the resources or entities being accessed, rather than on verbs that indicate operations on those resources.
6.Give an example of a good URL.    
-https://api.example.com/customers/123
7.What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
-Having a 'chatty' web API means that it requires a large number of small requests to retrieve necessary data, often leading to increased server load and reduced efficiency, making it generally a bad thing for performance.
8.What status code does a successful GET request return?
-200 OK
9.What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
-404 not found
10.What status code does a successful POST request return?
-201 Created
11.What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
-204 No content
