# What is OAuth?  

-OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.  

## History of OAuth  
- OAuth was released as an open standard in 2010 as RFC 5849, and quickly became widely adopted
- Today, you can add Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, Paypal and a list of other internet who’s-whos as adopters.

## OAuth examples  
-The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon.  
-Another example OAuth scenario could be a user sending cloud-stored files to another user via email, when the cloud storage and email systems are otherwise unrelated other than supporting the OAuth framework  
-In all cases, two or more services are being used for one transaction by the end-user, and every end-user would appreciate not being asked to log in a second time for what they feel is a single transaction.   

## How OAuth works  

- The first website connects to the second website using OAuth to verify the user's identity.  
-The second website generates a unique one-time token and secret for the transaction.  
-The first website provides this token and secret to the user's client software.  
-The client software presents the token and secret to the authorization provider (which might be -the second website).  
-The client may need to authenticate if not already authenticated.  
-After authentication, the client approves the transaction with the second website.  
-The user receives an approved access token.  
-The user provides the access token to the first website.   
-The first website gives the access token to the second website for user authentication.  
-The second website grants access to the first website on behalf of the user.  
-A successful transaction occurs, visible to the user.  
-OAuth's uniqueness lies in its web compatibility and widespread adoption compared to previous authentication systems like Kerberos.

## Questions  
1. What is OAuth?  
-It is like a digital key that you can use to unlock multiple online doors (websites and services) without needing a different key for each one.

2.Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.  
- When you try and sign up for render but instead of signing up through render, you sign up with your Google credentials.
  
3.How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
-works by allowing a user to grant a third-party application limited access to their account by providing the application with a temporary access token, typically through a series of steps involving user consent and authentication via an authorization server.  

4.What is OpenID?  
-OpenID is like a digital ID card you can use to prove who you are on the internet without needing a different username and password for every website or service you use.  

# Authentication and Authorization FlowsWhat is the difference between authorization and authentication?  
What is Authorization Code Flow?  
-Authorization Code Flow is a way for a website or app to securely check if you're allowed to use it by exchanging a special code for permission to access it, ensuring your data remains safe.  

What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
-Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a more secure version of the OAuth 2.0 authentication process, designed to protect your login credentials when you use apps and websites by generating a secret code that only the app can use to access your data.  

What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
-Implicit Flow with Form Post is an OAuth 2.0 authentication method where user tokens are directly returned in the URL and then hidden in a form for added security, primarily used in web applications.  

What is Client Credentials Flow?
-Client Credentials Flow is an OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanism that allows applications to authenticate and access resources directly without user involvement, typically used for machine-to-machine communication.  

What is Device Authorization Flow?
-Device Authorization Flow is an OAuth 2.0 authentication method designed for devices with limited input capabilities, allowing users to authorize access to their accounts via a separate device such as a smartphone or computer.  

What is Resource Owner Password Flow?  
-Resource Owner Password Flow is an OAuth 2.0 authentication method where users directly provide their credentials (username and password) to obtain an access token, typically used when the client application is trusted and secure.
