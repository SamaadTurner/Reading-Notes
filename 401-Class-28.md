# useEffect Hook:  
- useEffect is a React Hook for synchronizing a component with an external system.  
- It takes two main parameters: setup for the logic and an optional array of dependencies.  
- Setup function is executed when the component is added to the DOM and after each re-render with changed dependencies. It may also return a cleanup function.  
- Dependencies are values (props, state, variables) that trigger the effect when they change.  
useEffect should be used at the top level of a component.  
- It can be used to connect to external systems, control non-React widgets, fetch data, update state, and more.  
- Troubleshooting common issues like running the effect twice on mount, running it on every re-render, or infinite cycles is discussed.  
-UseLayoutEffect is recommended if the effect has noticeable visual changes.  
- Effects only run on the client, not during server rendering.

# Questions  
1. What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?  
- The main intended use case for the useEffect hook in React is to synchronize a component with an external system or perform side effects like data fetching, state updates, or cleanup in response to changes in the component's state or props.  
2. How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?  
- The effect's logic interacts with the component by executing the setup code when the component is added to the DOM and after each re-render with changed dependencies, and it can optionally return a cleanup function that runs when the component is removed from the DOM.
3. What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?  
- The return value from the effect's logic function is important as it specifies a cleanup function that is executed when the component is unmounted or before running the setup function on subsequent re-renders with changed dependencies, allowing for proper resource management and side effect cleanup.
