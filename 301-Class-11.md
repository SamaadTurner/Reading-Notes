# SQL vs NoSQL Database  
- SQL databases are mainly being called as Relational Databases. NoSQL databases are primarily being called as non-relational or distributed databases.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
- SQL databases are not good fit for hierachical data storage but NoSQL is a good fit for hierarchical data
- For properties: SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )
## Questions  
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?  
-highly structured data
Give a real world example.  
-inventory management 
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?  
-unstructured data  
Give a real world example.  
-an example of this would be storing and analyzing data from IoT sensors measuring temperature, humidity, and vibration in a factory environment.
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?  
-NoSQL
Which type of database is best for scalability?  
-best choice for scalability depends on factors such as the size of your dataset, expected user traffic, query patterns, data relationships, and the complexity of your application.  

# SQL vs NoSQL Video  
What does SQL stand for?  
-Structured Query Language  
What is a relational database?  
-A type of database that uses a structured format to store and manage data.  
What type of structure does a relational database work with?  
-A structured data storage model called the "relational model." This model organizes data into tables with rows and columns, and it emphasizes the relationships between tables.  
What is a ‘schema’?  
-The structure or blueprint that defines the organization, relationships, constraints, and attributes of the data stored in the database.  
What is a NoSQL database?  
- A type of database that manages data, often relying on a fixed schema and primarly works with unstructured data.  
How does it work?
-Works by storing and retrieving data using various data models and does not adhere to the traditional relational model, offering more flexible schemas, horizontal scalability through distributed systems, and optimized performance for specific data types and access patterns.  
What is inside of a MongoDB database?
-here are collections of flexible, JSON-like documents that can store diverse and structured data, each collection serving as a container for related data records.  
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
-MongoDB is generally considered more flexible than SQL databases due to its ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and dynamic schemas, allowing for easier adaptation to changing data requirements.  
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
-One disadvantage of a NoSQL database is that complex queries, including joins and aggregations across multiple collections, can be more challenging to perform compared to traditional SQL databases.
