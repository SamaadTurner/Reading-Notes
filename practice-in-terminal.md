# Obersvations  

I stumbled upon the terminal when I first started at CWU freshman year. Initially I knew what the terminal was but stayed away from it because I felt like it was a while different language. My intro to CS course recommended using the command line to diagnose problems and moving things around in your computer.. In fact my teacher required it since we were beginnners. Tentatively, I opened the terminal and typed my first command: "ls" to list files in a directory. To my surprise, it worked. It felt like unlocking a hidden doorway into my computer's inner workings.  

My exploration continued as I learned to navigate directories, create new ones, manipulate files, automate tasks with shell scripts, compile code, and manage software packages. The terminal became more than a tool; it became a mindset. It instilled precision and patience, making me a more efficient and confident software engineer. Debugging became easier, deployments smoother, and collaboration seamless. The terminal became an indispensable part of my toolkit, empowering me to navigate the complexities of software development with confidence and efficiency.
