# Review  
- Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes are build on protoypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.  
- The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets. This is where you define class members, such as methods or constructor.
## Questions  
1.Classes are a template for creating ____.  
-creating objects  
2.Can a class declaration be hoisted?  
-No  
3.How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?  
-A constructor is like a recipe that creates a specific type of object, and "this" is like a special ingredient that helps the recipe know which object it's currently working on when there are many of them.  

# Using Express Routing  
-Routing refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.  
-Define routing using methods of the Express app ibject that correspon to hTTP methods; an example is app.get() which handles GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests.  

Route Methods  
-A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class. 
  
Route Paths  
-Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.  

Route Handlers:  
-Can be in a form of a function, an array of functions, or combinations of both.

## Questions:  
1.What is an Express Router?   
-a middlewear that allows you to modularize and organize your routes and route handlers in a seperate and reusable way within an Express.js application.  
2. By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?  
-creating an instance of it using const router = express.Router();  
3.What do we use route middleware for?  
-We use route middlewear in Express.js to perform tasks or validations on incoming HTTP requests before they reach the route handler, allowing for code reuse and seperation of concerns.  

# Reflections:  
-stay on top of everything.  

## Things I want to know more about  
-more about what middleware is.
