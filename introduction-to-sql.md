## Intro to SQL


Relational databases are fundamental systems for efficiently organizing and managing structured data, employing tables and relationships to store information in a logical and structured manner. SQL (Structured Query Language) serves as the primary means of interacting with these databases, allowing users to create, modify, query, and extract data with ease. SQL offers a standardized and powerful set of commands for tasks like inserting, updating, and retrieving data, making it a crucial tool for database administrators, developers, and data analysts to ensure data integrity and accessibility within these relational database systems.
