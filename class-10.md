# What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript;  
-Two typpes of errors: syntax and logic.  
-Logic: hese are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.  
-Syntax: hese are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too.  
## Questions:  
1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error:
Syntax Error: Violates the rules of the programming language's syntax.  
Logic Error: Code is syntactically correct, but it produces unintended or incorrect results due to flawed logic.  
Syntax Error: Identified by the compiler or interpreter during compilation or interpretation.  
Logic Error: More challenging to detect as the code runs without error messages, but produces unexpected output.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
 -Some errors I have encountered were like missing semi-colons, closing tags, and even just wrong output out of a function. To fix these, I checked all my closing tags and made sure I had semi-colons where needed.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
-This topic is everything in programming. Errors should be looked at as helpful. They literally tell you what to fix.
# What are browser tools?:  
-These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load. This article explains how to use the basic functions of your browser's devtools.  
## Questions:  
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
-The JavaScript Debugger tool is a powerful feature that helps software developers identify and fix errors in their JavaScript code. By setting breakpoints, developers can pause the code's execution at specific lines and inspect variable values, allowing them to understand the program flow and pinpoint and resolve issues more effectively.
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
-A breakpoint is a specific point in the source code of a program where a developer sets a marker to pause the program's execution during debugging. When the program reaches the breakpoint, it stops, allowing the developer to inspect the program's state, analyze variables, and step through the code line by line to identify and understand any issues or unexpected behaviors.
3. What is the call stack?
-The call stack is a data structure used by programming languages to manage function calls during the execution of a program. It keeps track of the active function calls at any given moment. Whenever a function is called, its execution context (including variables and parameters) is pushed onto the top of the call stack. When the function completes its execution, its context is popped off the stack, and the program resumes execution from the point where the function was called.
