# Socket.IO chat  

- for some time, writing a chat application with popular web applications stacks has been very hard.
- With the introduction of Sockets, this has helped shift that problem. Sockets provide a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server.  
- What that means is that the server can push messages to clients. Whenever I write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.  

## Questions:  
1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.
-The chat example above creates chatbox on a webpage that use socket.io to connect to both a recciever and sender.  
2. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?
- A console log stating the port is listening ton incoming along with  a user has connected or disconnected.
3. Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?
- I would give the .broadcast


# Rooms (socket.io)  
- A room is an arbitary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients

## Questions:
1. What is a room and how might it be useful?
-A room is a channel that sockets can join. It is useful because it is a flow for privacy where you can message isolate to a specific room as opposed to one big room and no privacy.
2.How do you join a room?
-To join a room use the socket.join(roomName) method on the server-side, where roomName is the name or identifier of the room you want to join.
3.how do you leave a room?
-socket.leave(roomName).

# Namespaces  
- A namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called "multiplexing").

## Questions  
1. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?
-A namespace is a logical container that allows you to organize and isolate code, preventing naming conflicts and improving code organization.
2. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)
-rooms, events, and event handlers

3.Discuss a possible use case for seperate namespaces  
-it would create distinct chat areas (e.g., chat rooms) where users communicate independently, keeping conversations and events separate from one another.  

# Reflection  
-get better at coding.  

## Things I want to know more about
