# Express/Node Intro:  
-Node is an open-sourced, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JS.  

Benefits of Node:  
-Great performance  
-Code is written in "plain old JS"  
-JavaScript is a relatively new programming language and benefits from improvements in language design when compared to other traditional web-server languages  
-The node package manager (npm) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.  
- Most importantly, It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing to help.

What is express?  
-Express is the most popular Node web framework.  
-It provides mechanisms to:
*Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
*Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.  
*Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.  
*Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.  

## Questions:  
1.Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.  
- Middleware is like the glue that helps different software applications and systems communicate and work together smoothly. Imagine it as a bridge between two islands, where each island represents a different computer program or system.  

2.Express the most popular __ __ ____.  
- Node web framework  

3.Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?  
-far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used.  

4.What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?  
-A module is a self-contained, reusable piece of code that performs a specific function, and modularity is useful to developers because it promotes code organization, reusability, and easier maintenance, making the development process more efficient and less error-prone.  

# What is NPM?  
-Npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.  

## Questions  
1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
-9.8.1
2.What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
-npm install jshint

# What is TDD  
-a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests), and design (in the form of refactoring).  

## Questions:
1.Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
-Tests are important because they act like safety checks, helping to catch mistakes and ensure that computer programs work as intended, much like a safety net on a tightrope.
2.What are three expected benefits of testing  
-Error Detection, Quality Assurance, and Maintenance Ease
3.Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests. Individual Pitfalls:  
-Overlooking Edge Cases  
-Testing Incomplete Code  

Team Pitfalls:  
1.Lack of Communication  
2.Ignoring Test Maintenance  

# CI/CD:  
-Continous Integration  
-Continous Delivery  
-Continous Deployment  

## Questions:  
1.What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?  
- Early Detection of Bugs, Faster Development and Deployment, Improved Collaboration  
2.What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?  
-the primary distinction between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment is the manual step involved in releasing code changes to production. CD involves a manual decision to deploy, while Continuous
3.Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background  
-GitHub is like a central hub where teams of people working on a software project can store, track, and collaborate on their code changes, making it easier to work together and manage the process of building and releasing software.
