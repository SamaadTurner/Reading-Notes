# React: Component Lifecycle Events:  
React components can be defined as classes or functions.  
-Lifecycle events are methods used in React components to manage UI updates and application states.  
-Three phases of component lifecycle: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.  
-Mounting Phase:  
-Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount occur in order during mounting.  
-Updating Phase:  
-static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps happen during updating.  
-Unmounting Phase:  
-componentWillUnmount is the only lifecycle event during unmounting.  
-constructor() is called before a React component is mounted; use it to set state or bind event handlers.  
-Avoid using this.setState() in the constructor to prevent side effects and ignoring updates to props.  
-static getDerivedStateFromProps() is used when state relies on changes in props over time.  
-render() is a required method in class components; it examines this.props and this.state.  
-componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted; used for network requests or DOM initialization.  
-shouldComponentUpdate() can prevent unnecessary rerenders for performance optimization.  
-getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() captures a snapshot of the DOM before any changes.  
-componentDidUpdate() is useful for network requests after changes.  
-componentWillUnmount() cleans up the DOM and network requests/subscriptions when a component is removed.  
-UNSAFE Lifecycle Events:  
UNSAFE_componentWillMount(), UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(), UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps() are deprecated in React 17 and require the "UNSAFE" tag.  
-Use componentDidMount instead of componentWillMount.  
-Use static getDerivedStateFromProps instead of componentWillReceiveProps.  
-Use getSnapshotBeforeUpdate instead of componentWillUpdate.  
## Questions:  
1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
-Render.
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
-Constructor method is called.
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
-constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, then componentWillUnmount.

# Video Questions:  
1.What types of things can you pass in the props?  
-primitive data types, functions, objects, arrays, react elements, event handlers, callback functions, and also custom data types.  
2.What is the big difference between props and state?  
-Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used to manage and track data within a component itself.  
3.When do we re-render our application?  
-The application re-renders when there's a change in the component's state or props, triggering the rendering of the component's UI to reflect the updated data.  
4.What are some examples of things that we could store in state?  
-user input, UI State, counts or metrics, conditional rendering, api responses, toggle flags, progress and loading, error handling, selected items.
