# Securing Passwords 

- Passwords are the first line of defense against cyber criminals. It is used in most things in your daily life, from unlocking your phone to checking your bank account.
- Because of this, cryptographic hash alogorithms and the functions are designed to "calculate a digest of huge amounts of data in as short time as possible".
- hashing is the best way to protect passwords.  
  
## Benefits of hashing:  
-If passwords is compromised, only the hashes will be taken as opposed to the actual plain text password.  

## Problems with hash algorithm   
-Though hashing is great, one problem with it is when it is hit with a Brute Force Attack. Since hashing cannot be reversed, a hacker can run program that tries every single password combination until correct one is found.  

-Hash collision attack: Hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, so there is inevitably going to be the possibility of two different inputs that produce the same output hash. MD5, SHA1, SHA2 are vulnerable to Hash Collision Attack i.e. two input strings of a hash function that produce the same hash result.  

## Questions:  
1.Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.  
- Imagine turning your password into a secret recipe that can only be used for verification but can't be turned back into the original password, and then locking it in a secure vault.  
  
2.What is Bcrypt?  
-Bcrypt is a widely-used cryptographic hashing function specifically designed for securely storing passwords by irreversibly transforming them into a unique and salted hash, making it difficult for attackers to decipher the original passwords even if they access the hash.  

3.Why might you use something like Bcrypt?  
-You would use something like Bcrypt to enhance the security of stored passwords by making it extremely challenging for attackers to crack or decrypt them, even if they gain access to the hashed values.  

# Basic AuthO  
## Questions:
1. What is Basic Authentication?
- a method of user authentication where a username and password is sent to an encoded form as an HTTP request.  
2.What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?
- "Authorization" field with the word "Basic" followed by a space and the base64-encoded combo of the username and password in the format "username:password."  
3.How are username:password in Basic Auth encoded?
- base64

# Authentication Cheat Sheet  
## Questions:  
1.Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter.  
-Authentication is like showing your ID card at the entrance; it's a way for a system to confirm that you are who you claim to be before granting access to certain resources or information.  

2.How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?  
- should provide clear and informative responses to help users and developers diagnose issues effectively, enhancing user experience and facilitating troubleshooting.

# Additional Questions  
-I look forwarded to working with more Authentication things.  
- My learning goals are still the same... Get better all around.

## Things I want to know more about  
-everything.
