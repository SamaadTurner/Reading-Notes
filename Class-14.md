# CSS Transforms:  
-The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.  
-ex: div {  
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);  
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);  
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);  
          transform: scale(1.5);  
}  
-The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.  
## Question:  
1.What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?  
-CSS transform allows the developer to modify an element's position, rotation, scale, and skew, enabling them to create visually appealing and interactive effects without changing the element's original dimensions in the document flow. It enhances the layout and presentation of web content with smooth animations and transformations.  
2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.  
-One example of a CSS transform is rotating an image element. Let's say you have a logo on your website, and you want it to rotate continuously to add a subtle dynamic effect.  

# CSS Transitions and Animations:  
-A transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.  
-The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.  
-There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.  
## Questions:  
1.What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?  
-A CSS transition allows the developer to smoothly animate the changes in an element's style properties over a specified duration. It enables the creation of fluid and visually pleasing effects when elements undergo modifications, such as hovering over a button to change its background color.  
2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?  
-CSS transitions smoothly animate changes in an element's style over a specified duration when triggered by user actions or property changes. On the other hand, CSS animations are predefined sequences of style changes that run continuously without user interaction, allowing for more complex and continuous effects.  

# 8 simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users:  
-All of these effects (bar one) are controlled with the transition property.  
-Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.  
-Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them.  
-To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding.  
-CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element.  
-A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa.  
-3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.  
-Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.  
-One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border. We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position. We could fix that problem using box sizing, but a far simpler solution is the transition in a border using an inset box shadow.
