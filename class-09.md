# HTML Web Forms:  
-Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users â€” most commonly they are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface.  
-The flexibility of forms makes them one of the most complex structures in HTML; you can build any kind of basic form using dedicated form elements and attributes. Using the correct structure when building an HTML form will help ensure that the form is both usable and accessible.  

# How to structure a web from:  
-The &lt;form> element formally defines a form and attributes that determine the form's behavior.  
-each time you want to create an HTML form, you must start it by using this element, nesting all the contents inside. Many assistive technologies and browser plugins can discover <form> elements and implement special hooks to make them easier to use.  
## Questions:  
1. Why are forms so important in web development?
-Forms are essential in web development because they allow users to interact and submit data, enabling various functionalities like login, registration, and data input. They facilitate communication between users and web applications, making them a crucial element for gathering information and providing personalized experiences.
2.When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?  
-simplicity and clarity, responsive and mobile friendly, visual hierarchy, and accessibility among many others.  
3.List 5 form elements and explain their importance.  
-Textbox, radio buttons, checkbox, dropdown, and textarea

# Learn JS:  
-JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex functionalities on web pages.  
# Introduction to events:  
-Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.  
-The system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs.  
## Questions:  
1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
   -Events in JavaScript are like notifications or messages that tell your code when something interesting happens, such as a button being clicked, a key being pressed, or a webpage finishing loading. They allow your code to react and perform specific actions when these events occur, making your website or application interactive and responsive to user actions.  
2.When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?  
-even type and event handler function
3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
-The event object in JavaScript represents an occurrence or action triggered by the user or the browser, such as a mouse click, key press, or form submission.
-The "target" property within the event object is particularly useful because it refers to the DOM element that triggered the event.
4.What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
-In event bubbling, the event starts at the target element and then moves up the DOM hierarchy, triggering event handlers on ancestor elements. Event capturing works in the opposite direction, starting at the outermost ancestor element and moving down to the target element, allowing event handlers on ancestor elements to intercept the event before it reaches the target.
