# Choosing the State Structure:  
- Structuring state well can make a difference between a component that is pleasant to modify and debug, and one that is a constant source of bugs.

## Questions:
1. Summarize the five principles for structuring state.
- To better state management in software, you need to:  group related state, avoid contradictions, redundancies, and duplications, and favor flat over deeply nested state structures for easier updates and maintenance. Following these principles helps maintain clean and efficient state management in your applications.


# Passing Data Deeply with Context:  

- Propagate Data Efficiently: Context in React allows information sharing from a parent component to its descendants, eliminating the need to pass props through intermediary components, which can become unwieldy.  
-Simplify Data Access: It enables any component in the tree below the provider to access the shared information, making it a useful tool for avoiding repetitive prop passing in cases where multiple components require the same data.

# Questions:  
1. What problem do Contexts aim to solve?
- Contexts aim to solve the problem of efficiently sharing data across multiple components in a React application, particularly when the data needs to bypass many intermediary components.
2. What is one technique to try before useContext?
- One technique to try before using useContext in React is to utilize prop drilling, passing data through component props, and lifting state up to higher-level components when necessary.
3. What hook complements useContext for complex applications?
- The useReducer hook complements useContext for complex applications, providing a predictable way to manage and update state shared via context.
